# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

This project was created mainly using JavaScript. Webpack was used to maintain assets and to import libraries such as 'date-fns'. In this project, when a user opens the webpage, the weather will display a default weather (Vancouver) to the user. Vancouver's weather is displayed using openweathermap's API using async/await. Moreover, the user is able to input any city in the world, if the City does not exist, the weather will fallback on Vancouver's weather.

# Lessons Learn:
I learned a lot about API and async/await and how data is retrieved in a certain amount of time from a certain URL. Moreover, libraries are very helpful when it suits the situation.
